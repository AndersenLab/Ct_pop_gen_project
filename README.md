# Ct_pop_gen_project

This repository contains scripts and files used to perform the analyses and make the figures and tables associated with the *Caenorhabditis tropicalis* population genetics manuscript 

- The "data" folder contains the raw datasets from public database (*e.g.* CaeNDR)
- The "plots" folder contains all the figures generated by the scripts
- The "processed_data" folder contains all the intermediate results files generated during the analysis.
- The "scripts" folder contains all the codes used for generating figures and tables.
- The "tables" folder contains all the tables generated by the scripts
